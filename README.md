Choosing a doctor is a tough decision. There are many parameters we look for when we are in need of a good doctor, those includes, skill, experience, long-standing track record, ratings, review recommendations. bestdoctorz.com as the name suggests is a web application that suggest you the best doctors specific to patients needs.

The idea came in my mind when my friend was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I wanted to help him find a good trusted oncologist in my native. Then the question was, how can I find good oncologist in a specific area? I spent days scanning through dozens of doctor listing websites, but couldn't spot any website which can suggest a good oncologist doctor. Even today, searching for the best specialized doctors on major search engines doesnâ€™t provide reliable answers. This was when I decided to start work on an application that can help patients to find best doctors.

Today,bestdoctorz.com has got 80K+ registered doctors with hundreds of visits per day
